			<h2>Demoloaders&trade;: Impact on publishers</h2>

			<p>A good demo game has proved over time to be a powerful tool to both sell and promote videogames</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Each install of a demo-game represents a chance to convert that player to a customer</li>
				<li>Each install represents a chance to have an evangelist talking about your game- even if they can't make a purchase then</li>

			</ul>

<p>However, as games have become more complicated, and launch timing more critical they have become more challenging to implement:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Authoring an effective demo-game requires skill, testing and time</li>
				<li>Cutting down a game to make a demo-game without breaking the game has become more involved</li>
				<li>The risk to the main game launch of delays due to the demo-game authoriing has become more severe</li>

			</ul>

<p>Tangentix Demoloaders are different:</p>
<ul>
				<li>They are authored automatically, so there is no launch delay or resource required</li>
				<li>The behaviour of the demo-game can be controlled remotely based on real player behaviour and real-time analytics</li>
				<li>The player already has the full game assets, so they don't have to download the game at purchase- minimizing purchase friction</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Demoloaders&trade;: Process & Technology</h2>
			<p>Demoloaders are created automatically from a finsihed game- no access is required to the original game code which remains unchanged.</p>

<p><a class="link" href="compression.html">Tangentix compression</a> means the Demoloader is typically 3x smaller than the original game.</p>

<p>The Tangentix Demoloader Sandbox&trade; protects the content and allows the behaviour and functionality of the demo-game to be controlled from the web.</p>



<p>When purchased, the Demoloader Sandbox&trade; is removed to leave the full game in place.</p>

				<h2>Demoloaders&trade;: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3>How long can you play on a Demoloader&trade;?</h3>
			<p>Through the cloud-management system the publisher controls the amount and timing of free play according to the data on conversion the system provides. It's even possible to spread access to the demo over a number of days if this results in a better result.</p>
			<h3>How long does it take to make a Demoloader&trade;?</h3>
			<p>Our systems now cover most of the major game engines and we're adding more constantly. For all the ones that are completed in takes our servers about 1-4 hours to complete the conversion</p>
			<h3>How big will a Demoloader&trade; be?</h3>
			<p>Typically a Demoloader&trade; will be around 1/3rd of the size of the original game. You can see some examples <a class="link" href="compression.html#portfolio">here</a>.</p>
			<h3>How can publishers engage with players using a Demoloader&trade;?</h3>
			<p>During gameplay our engine monitors the game activity and, at appropriate times, shows "overlays" over the paused game. These can be any web-based content, pages, video, surveys, animation etc. As all this is delivered from the cloud it can be modified instantly to suit the publishers needs.</p>
			<h3>What changes are needed to the game?	</h3>
			<p>None. We take the completed gold-disk master and turn it into a Demoloader&trade; without changing a single byte of the program code. We need no source code access.</p>
			<h3>Does it work with Steam?</h3>
			<p>It works well with Steam. Both demo and full game can be delivered via Steam and by a process of "Adoption" by the Steam client the demo can be converted to a full game.</p>
